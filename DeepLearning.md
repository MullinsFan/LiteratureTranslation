`Abstract: Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change it's internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.`
摘要：深度学习允许由多个处理层组成的计算机模型去学习具有多个抽象层次的数据表示。这些方法显著地增强了在语音识别、视觉对象识别、目标检测，甚至许多其他领域如药物发现和基因组学的最高水平。深度学习通过使用反向传播算法探索在大数据集中的复杂结构，预测一个机器如何改变它的内部参数，这些参数用于计算每一层中来自其之前层的表示的表示。深度卷积网络在图像、视频、语音和音频处理方面取得了突破性进展，而循环网络在文本、语音等序列数据处理方面也取得了突破性进展。
`Machine-learning technology powers many aspects of modern society: from web searches to content filtering on social networks to recommendations on e-commerce websites,  and it is increasingly present in consumer products such as cameras and smartphones. Machine-learning systems are used to identify objects in images, transcribe speech into text, match news items, posts or products with user's interests, and select relevant results of search. 6: Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning.`
机器学习技术为现代社会的许多方面提供了动力：从网络搜索到在社交网络上的内容过滤，再到电子商务网站上的推荐，它越来越多的出现在摄像头和智能手机等消费产品中。机器学习系统被用来检测图像中的物体，将语音转化成文本，根据用户的兴趣匹配新闻项目、帖子或产品，并选择相关的搜索结果。6：这些应用程序越来越多的使用一种被称为深度学习的技术。
`Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data(such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or 分类 patterns in the input.`
传统的机器学习技术受限于他们处理自然数据的原始形式方面的能力。数十年来，构造一个识别模式或者机器学习系统需要缜密的工程设计和大量的领域专业知识来设计一个特征提取器,将原始数据（如一个图像的像素值）压缩成合适的内部表示或者特征向量，学习子系统（通常是分类器）能够检测和校准输入中的模式。
`Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level(starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level.  With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned. 11: For classification tasks, higher layers of representation amplify aspects of the input are important for discrimination and suppress irrelevant variations. An image, for example, comes in the form of an array of pixel values, and the learned features in the first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image. The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions. The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure.`
表示学习是允许为机器提供原始数据，机器自动发现检测或分类所需表示的一类方法。深度学习方法是具有表示形式的多层次的表示学习方法，它是通过组合简单但非线性模块获得的，每个模块将一个层次（从原始输入开始）的表示转化为更高，更抽象层次的表示。有了足够多的此类转换，就可以学习非常复杂的功能。对于分类任务，较高的表示层会放大输入的各个方面，这对区分和抑制不相关的变化十分重要。比如说，图像以像素值阵列形式出现，并且在表示的第一层中学习的特征通常是表示图像特定方向和位置上边缘的存在或不存在。第二层通常通过发现图像边缘的特定布置来检测图案，而不管边缘位置的微小变化。第三层可以将图案组装成与熟悉的对象的各个部分相对应的较大组合，并且随后的层将把对象检测为这些部分的组合。深度学习的关键方面是上述各层的功能都不是人工设计的，而是通过通用学习程序从数据中学习到的。
`Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. In addition to beating records in image recognition and speech recognition, it has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules, analysing particle acclerator data, reconstruction brain circuits, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease. Purhaps more surprisingly, deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding, particularly topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering and language translation.`
深度学习正在解决人工智能届尽最大努力很多年却没有收获的问题上取得重大进展。事实证明，它非常擅长发现高维数据中的复杂结构，因此适用于科学、商业和政府的诸多领域。深度学习除了在图像识别和语音识别打破记录以外，它还在预测潜在药物分子的活性、分析粒子加速器数据、重建脑回路和预测突变对非编码DNA在基因表达和疾病上的影响上击败了其他的机器学习技术。可能更令人吃惊的是，深度学习在各种自然语言理解中取得了极好的成果，特别是主题分类、情感分析、自动回答和语言翻译。
`We think that deep learning will have many more success in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage by of increases in the amount of available computation and data. New learning algorithms and architectures that are currently being developed for deep neural networks will only accelerate this progress.`
我们任务深度学习在不久的将来会取得更多的成果，因为它只需要极少的人工操作，因此他也很容易受益于有效计算能力和数据量的增长。目前正在为神经网络所开发的新的学习算法和架构只会加速这一进程。
### Supervised learning
监督学习
`The most common form of machine learning, deep or not, is supervised learning. Imagine that we want to build a system that can classify images as containing, say, a house, a car, a person or a pet, each labelled with it's category. During training, the machine is shown an image and produces an output in the form of a vector of scores, one for each category. We want the desired category to have the highest score of all categories, but this is unlikely to happen before training. We compute an objective function that measures the error (or distance) between the output scores and the desired pattern of scores. The machine then modifies it's internal adjustable parameters to reduce this error. These adjustable parameters, often called weights, are real numbers that can be seen as 'knobs' that define the input-output function of the machine. In a typical deep-learning system, there may be hundreds of millions of these adjustable weights, and hundreds of millions of labelled examples with which to train the machine.`
机器学习最常见的学习形式，无论是不是深层的都是监督学习。试想一下，我们要建立一个系统，他可以对一个包含了房、车、人或宠物的图片进行分类，并将标上它的类别。在训练过程中，机器会显示一张图片，并以向量形式的分数为输出，每个分类一个输出。我们希望所需的类别在所有的类别中得分最高，但这不可能在训练前完成。我们计算一个目标函数，来测量输出分数与所需模式分数之间的误差（或距离）。然后机器通过修正内部可修改参数来降低误差。这些被称为权值的可调参数是可视为旋钮的实数，这些数字决定了机器的输入/输出功能。在一个典型的深度学习系统中，一般拥有数以亿计的这些可调权值，和数以亿计的在机器上训练的带标签样本。
`To properly adjust the weight vector, the learning algorithm computes a gradient vector that, for each weight, indicates by what amount the error would increase or decrease if the weight were increased by a tiny amount. The weight vector is then adjusted in the opposite direction to the gradient vector.`
为了适当的调整权值向量，学习算法会为每一个权值计算一个梯度向量，用来表示当权值增加一个微小值时，误差增加或降低的值。**然后权值向量向梯度向量相反的方向进行调整**
`The objective function, averaged over all the training examples, can be seen as a kind of hilly landscape in the high-dimensional space of weight values. The negative gradient vector indicates the direction of steepest descent in this landscape, taking it closer to a minimum, where the output error is low on average.`
所有训练样本上平均的目标函数，可以看作是权值在多维空间上的丘陵地形。负的梯度向量表示在该地形中下降方向最快，使其更接近于最小值，也就是平均输出误差最小的地方。
`In practice, most practitioners use a procedure called stochastic gradient descent(SGD).`
